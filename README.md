##PEER-GRADED ASSIGNMENT REPOSITORY
It contains 3 scripts, the codebook, this readme and the final dataset called cleanedata.txt
#1 The scripts are Setting working directory.R, Store as objects each dataset.R and run_analysis.R
##1.1 Setting working directory.R
After downloading and unzipping the files sets the working directory where the files are
##1.2 Store as objects each dataset.R
This script store each desired file as an R object and change column names in order to prepare them to create the merged data set
##1.3 run_analysis.R performs precisely the tasks asked in the project, particularly:
1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
Finally it export the cleaned final dataset as a text file named cleanedata.txt
#2 The codebook describe the programming codes used to achieve the project goals
#3 This README.md explains how the scripts are connected and the name of the file obtained
#4 cleanedata.txt contains the final cleaned data set obtained
